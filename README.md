# Scientific_Reports_Examples
These are a couple formal reports I made to demonstrate my ability to create a well written and clear report.

- "Kraters_Pendulum_lab_formal" is written using REVTeX 4 to match APS's journal standard at the time of writting
- "PID_Project_Proposal" was written to present to my school's administration to justify the project. Not all of its deliverables were acheived due to the onset of COVID-19
